## Files in this Repository

1. **`run_analysis.R`**: This R script performs the following steps:
   1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
(these are the ones described in the coursera assignment page)

2. **`CodeBook.md`**: This file describes the variables dataset and transformations.


3. ## Run the Script
The script is runable, on its own, the only thing that has to be done is change directory to the appropriate one.
